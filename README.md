## What is OneGame WorldBuilder?

The OneGame WorldBuilder is a sandbox game made in Unity. In OneGame, players can create various minigames using their imagination (the minigame builders) for other players (the playtesters) to review and play. In turn, the system rewards the builders based on popularity and rankings, and the playtesters will get rewarded for playing. The rewards are in the form of OneGame tokens, or *OGT*.

For more information on play or build the project, please consult the wiki.
